ePROCESS is an Information Management System for recording, processing, producing, publishing and communicating information about candidates for recruitment and originally developed for the Human Resources Department of the Ministry of Public Service of the Republic of Congo.

The eProcess application was developed in 2012 with the technical contribution of Novi Sonko, now senior consultant at Sonkotek Systems, who worked as an analyst, systems architect and software developer in this project.

The objective of creating this system was to improve the overall administrative process for processing staff recruitment files: from the registration of candidatesâ€™ files to the publication of employment contracts, as well the monitoring of the relevant administrative processes throughout the departments of the ministry.

Since its introduction in 2012, eProcess has become essential for meeting the traceability needs of administrative documents processed at the ministry.
